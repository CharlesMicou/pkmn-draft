<h3>Win-Conditions and Checks</h3>
<p>
    You win a game by knocking out all of your opponent's Pokemon, but you've known that since 1998.
    The trick to winning consistently is to manoeuvre yourself into a game-state in which your opponent cannot prevent
    you from cleaning up their whole team. This is just like how a chess game eventually reaches a tipping point
    when one player identifies a sequence of moves that inescapably leads to mate.
</p>

<p>
    A 'win-condition' is a game-state that takes you past that tipping point. For example: a
    <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/pokemon/dragonite/">Dragonite</a> that has used
    <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/moves/dragon-dance/">Dragon Dance</a> a couple of times to boost its stats
    will likely instantly KO incoming Pokemon before they have a chance to use moves of their own. However, an opposing
    <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/pokemon/cloyster/">Cloyster</a>
    with <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/moves/ice-shard/">Ice Shard</a> will be able to prevent
    Dragonite's rampage. Cloyster 'checks' the Dragonite win-condition.
</p>

<p>
    Newer Pokemon players are often surprised when they lose games that they appeared to have an advantage in. For
    example: they knocked out three of their opponent's Pokemon in exchange for only one of their own. However, if the
    one Pokemon our newbie lost was the only part of their team keeping a still-present threat in check, they might
    still be in a lot of trouble!
</p>

<p>
    The two questions we need to ask ourselves as players are:
<li>How can I check my opponent's win conditions?</li>
<li>How can I get rid of my opponent's checks for <i>my</i> win conditions?</li>
</p>

<p>
    Win conditions do not necessarily mean a single powerful Pokemon. Inflicting poison on all your opponent's team
    and while having tanky team members to buy time is just one example of a team-wide win-condition.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, threatening to KO a Pokemon is far from the only way to check it. Inflicting paralysis on a potential
    'sweeper' (see below) can nullify its ability to function as a win-condition.
</p>

<p>
    In a draft format, unlike an established metagame, you'll need to reevaluate what the win conditions and checks are
    in every game. The rest of this primer is really just a description of important core game mechanics that you need
    to know about to inform your evaluations.
</p>

<h3>Pokemon Roles</h3>

<p>
    There's some jargon in the competitive Pokemon world that helps us understand the roles individual Pokemon play
    within a team.
</p>
<li><b>Lead:</b> Suitable to send out first in battle.</li>
<li><b>Wall:</b> Takes very little damage.</li>
<li><b>Pivot:</b> Good at switching in and out, often forcing your opponent to switch.</li>
<li><b>Setter:</b> Modifies the battle state by changing the weather, introducing hazards, etc.</li>
<li><b>Support:</b> Lots of utility moves, such as healing allies or inflicting status.</li>
<li><b>Sweeper:</b> Has the potential to KO all opposing Pokemon.</li>
<li><b>Trapper:</b> A Pokemon with the ability to prevent its opponent from switching.</li>

<p>
    Not all teams will feature all of these roles, and some Pokemon can fill multiple roles at once. A very aggressive
    team
    might feature no walls, but several pivots and sweepers. A very defensive team might rely purely on walls, supports,
    and
    pivots and plan to win through attrition.
</p>

<h3>Important Game Mechanics</h3>

<h4>Turn Order</h4>

<p>One of the two sides moves first each turn. This is <i>really</i> important.</p>
<li>If one player switched Pokemon, this happens first*. If both players switched, the order is randomised</li>
<li>The game compares the priority of moves used. Higher priority goes first.</li>
<li>If both moves are of the same priority, the Pokemon with the higher Speed (Spe) stat goes first. Ties are broken at
    random.
</li>

<p>* Edge case: The move <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/moves/pursuit/">Pursuit</a> can be used to damage a Pokemon switching out, otherwise its priority is normal.</p>

As a general rule of thumb:
<li>Nearly all moves have priority 0.</li>
<li>Moves that prevent damage like Protect have priority +4.</li>
<li>Moves that are 'fast attacks' like Quick Attack have priority +1.</li>
<li>Moves that are 'extra fast attacks' like Extreme Speed have priority +2.</li>
<li>Moves that reflect damage like Counter have priority -5.</li>

A full list of move priorities is <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Priority">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Damage Types and Base Stats</h4>

<p>Nearly all damaging moves are one of two types: physical and special. Physical moves use the
    attacker's Attack stat (Atk) and the defender's Defence stat (Def) to calculate damage. Special moves use Special
    Attack (SpA) and Special Defence (SpD). Pokemon <i>usually</i> specialise into one attacking type based on their
    underlying offensive stats. Some walls have dramatic differences between their Def and SpD stats:
    <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/pokemon/chansey/">Chansey</a>'s base SpD is over 20x higher than its base
    Def, so a weak physical move will do more damage than a strong physical one! Different Pokemon also have different
    base HP values.
</p>

<h4>STAB</h4>
(Same-Type-Attack-Bonus) Example: A Water-type Pokemon using a Water-type attack will do 1.5x more
damage than a non-Water-type Pokemon using the same move.

<p><b>Stat boosts:</b> Various items and moves can raise or lower the Atk/Def/SpA/SpD stats used in the damage
    calculation.</p>
