<h2><i>An Introduction to Pokemon Draft</i></h2>

<p>
    Here's the overall plan:</p>
<li>You get together with some friends to make a group of 2-6 people</li>
<li>You all draft pokemon from a pool and use them to build a team</li>
<li>You battle each other with the teams you made</li>

<p>But given that you're reading this, you probably want the juicy details.
    As a tip: you can start a draft with only 1 Player to get a feel for how the system works.
</p>

<h3>What are we drafting?</h3>

<p>Each time you make a draft pick you're selecting a 'complete' Pokemon: all its stats, moves, and items have been
    pre-selected for you. What you click on in the draft is what you get!</p>

<p>Each Pokemon in the draft is unique. They're drawn from a pool of about 120 different sets that I've put
    together.</p>

<h3>How does drafting work?</h3>

<p>A draft consists of some number of rounds, and at the start of each round every player opens a 'pack' of Pokemon.
    The number of rounds and the number of Pokemon in each pack both depend on how many players are in the lobby.
</p>

<p>You get to pick one Pokemon from your pack, and then you 'pass' the pack to the player next in the draft order
    from you. You'll then receive a pack from the person before you in the order, which you will take one Pokemon from
    and pass on, and so on. Once all the packs are empty, the next round starts. After all the rounds are done, you can
    build your team.</p>

<h3>How do I build a team?</h3>

<p>You'll have drafted somewhere between 12 and 18 Pokemon depending on the number of players in the lobby. A Pokemon
    team has 6 members, so you'll need to think about which to include in your final team.</p>

<p>We're using a self-hosted version of Pokemon showdown, which you can also build your team on. Follow the steps
    below.</p>

<h3>Using Pokemon showdown</h3>

<p>
    Visit the draft <a href="http://happylittleneurons.com.psim.us/">Pokemon showdown instance</a> and select a username using the button in the top right
    corner. Your username needs to be unique among all Pokemon showdown users, even the official instance, because
    authentication routes through their servers. Once you have a name, open the team builder.

<p>
    Select 'New Team'. Then, from the 'Format' drop down select '[gen9] draft rules' (the only option). Click 'Import
    from text', and then go to your draft page and copy the sets for the Pokemon you drafted. Paste these into the
    teambuilder's import field.
</p>

<p>
    You'll now need to delete entries from your team until you have the 6 Pokemon that make up your final team.
    <span style="color: red;"><b>DO NOT CHANGE THE MOVES, STATS, ABILITIES, ITEMS, ETC. OF THE POKEMON YOU DRAFTED. THAT'S CHEATING!</b></span>
</p>

<p>
    Once you're happy with your final selection, give your team a name and return to 'Home' in Pokemon showdown.
    You're now ready to battle other players! You can either click the 'Battle!' button to find a random opponent who
    has also clicked this button, or you can use the chat command '/challenge' to issue a direct
    challenge to someone in your draft group.
</p>

<h3>Which Pokemon Should I Draft?</h3>
<p>The Pokemon in the pool to draft from range in power level from RU to OU, with most Pokemon having been in the OU
    tier for at least one generation in the last decade. This means that while some individual Pokemon may be 'better'
    than others in a complete vacuum, you should focus on building a cohesive team.</p>

<p>You should look for Pokemon that complement each other. For example, if you pick up a Pokemon that changes the
    weather or terrain, look for other Pokemon that would benefit from that effect.</p>

<p>You should look to sure-up weaknesses: make sure you have a variety of attacking and defensive types.</p>

<p>Finally, you should look to screw over the other people in the draft. If you have the opportunity to take a specific
    Pokemon that would cause serious problems for your team, consider taking it so that your opponents can't have
    it!</p>
